          Hi! I’m Erich, a fourth-year Information Technology student at Western Mindanao State University, driven by a passion for coding, hardware troubleshooting, and optimizing digital experiences. Much like a well-structured algorithm, I approach problems with logic, efficiency, and adaptability.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise lies in software development, system troubleshooting, and visual resolution technologies, where I continuously debug challenges and innovate solutions. I enjoy teaching others about technology, sharing knowledge, and fostering growth within the tech community.
        </p>
